<p class="p1">A LOT of the underneath the hood stuff is contained within documentation.html, but here are some of the design decisions I feel warrant extra attention.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">1. SQL DATABASES</p>
<p class="p1">I created 3 SQL databases: sports, portfolio, and users.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Sports is the most straightforward. Because of the sheer number of sports, it made more sense to store them in a database than hard code them as options in forms. This is manifested in the pitch adding view/controller.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Portfolio contains ALL of the articles in the database. It is accessed by almost every controller; the primary index is “id,” but it is joined by “userid” which keeps track of which user’s article it is. It also contains title, sport, link, type, status, and duedate columns. Not all of these will be full at all times (userid is set to 0, link is empty when its pitched), but will eventually be filled before the article can reach the final stage of ‘evolution’ and become published. Keeping track of userid proved to be invaluable.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Users contains information about every registered user. Its columns are userid (primary), username (unique), hash, name, huid, email, cell_number, and role.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">2. SERVER-SIDE VS CLIENT-SIDE VALIDATION</p>
<p class="p1">Validation throughout this website are done both server-side and client-side. I picked between the two based on usefulness and simplicity. For things like checking passwords, registration codes, etc… server-side validation made far more sense. I also used server-side PHP validation to check if certain fields were left empty, because I wanted the user to try and submit first.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Client-side validation using JavaScript was done within specific fields in registration forms: HUID, email, name, and cell #. This allowed me to alert the user about a potential mistake BEFORE they load the entire page, which seemed to be more efficient.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">3. EMAIL FORM</p>
<p class="p1">I really wanted to include this functionality, so I took advantage of Postmark’s servers in lieu of Cloud9. The form is somewhat primitive but does exactly what I wanted it to, which is to send the contents of the submission to an email of the site manager’s choice (eventually will be the comp director’s email).</p>
